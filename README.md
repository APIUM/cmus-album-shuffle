# cmus-album-shuffle
A hacky 'album shuffle' mode implementation for the cmus music player

This will allow cmus to play an album from start to finish (in order), then select another (random) album, then play that from start to finish....

To use, download the script to a convenient location, ensure it is executable, then from cmus, :set status_display_program=/path/to/location/albumshuffle.sh
